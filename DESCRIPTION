Description: provides raw files recorded on different Liquid
  Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) instruments. All included MS
  instruments are manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific and belong to the
  Orbitrap Tribrid or Q Exactive Orbitrap family of instruments. Despite their
  common origin and shared hardware components (e.g. Orbitrap mass analyser),
  the above instruments tend to write data in different "dialects" in a shared
  binary file format (.raw). The intention behind tartare is to provide complex
  but slim real-world files that can be used to make code robust with respect
  to this diversity. In other words, it is intended for enhanced unit testing.
  The package is considered to be used with the
  rawDiag package (Trachsel, 2018 <doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00173>) and the
  Spectra MsBackends.
